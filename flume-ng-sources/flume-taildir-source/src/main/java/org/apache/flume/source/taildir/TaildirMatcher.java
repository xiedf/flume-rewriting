/**
 * Identifies and caches the files matched by single file pattern for {@code TAILDIR} source.
 * <p></p>
 * Since file patterns only apply to the fileNames and not the parent dictionaries, this
 * implementation checks the parent directory for modification (additional or removed files
 * update modification time of parent dir)
 * If no modification happened to the parent dir that means the underlying files could only be
 * written to but no need to rerun the pattern matching on fileNames.
 * <p></p>
 * This implementation provides lazy caching or no caching. Instances of this class keep the
 * result file list from the last successful execution of {@linkplain #getMatchingFiles()}
 * function invocation, and may serve the content without hitting the FileSystem for performance
 * optimization.
 * <p></p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> It is assumed that the hosting system provides at least second granularity
 * for both {@code System.currentTimeMillis()} and {@code File.lastModified()}. Also
 * that system clock is used for file system timestamps. If it is not the case then configure it
 * as uncached. Class is solely for package only usage. Member functions are not thread safe.

   * Lists those files within the parentDir that match regex pattern passed in during object

   * <p></p>
   * Based on the modification of the parentDir this function may trigger cache recalculation by
   * calling {@linkplain #getMatchingFilesNoCache()} or
   * return the value stored in {@linkplain #lastMatchedFiles}.
   * Parentdir is allowed to be a symbolic link.
   * <p></p>
   * Files returned by this call are weakly consistent (see {@link DirectoryStream}).
   * It does not freeze the directory while iterating,
   * so it may (or may not) reflect updates to the directory that occur during the call,
   * In which case next call
   * will return those files (as mtime is increasing it won't hit cache but trigger recalculation).
   * It is guaranteed that invocation reflects every change which was observable at the time of
   * invocation.
   * <p></p>
   * Matching file list recalculation is triggered when caching was turned off or
   * if mtime is greater than the previously seen mtime
   * (including the case of cache hasn't been calculated before).
   * Additionally if a constantly updated directory was configured as parentDir
   * then multiple changes to the parentDir may happen
   * within the same second so in such case (assuming at least second granularity of reported mtime)
   * it is impossible to tell whether a change of the dir happened before the check or after
   * (unless the check happened after that second).
   * Having said that implementation also stores system time of the previous invocation and previous
   * invocation has to happen strictly after the current mtime to avoid further cache refresh
   * (because then it is guaranteed that previous invocation resulted in valid cache content).
   * If system clock hasn't passed the second of
   * the current mtime then logic expects more changes as well
   * (since it cannot be sure that there won't be any further changes still in that second
   * and it would like to avoid data loss in first place)
   * hence it recalculates matching files. If system clock finally
   * passed actual mtime then a subsequent invocation guarantees that it picked up every
   * change from the passed second so
   * any further invocations can be served from cache associated with that second
   * (given mtime is not updated again).
   *
